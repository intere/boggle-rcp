# boggle-rcp
Eclipse RCP Version of Boggle.  It's multi-player with computer players.  There is plenty of work to be done on it, however it's pretty slick.

Yep - it's old, it uses XML.  It *should* be using JSON.  I've got code generators to help out with that...


## Setup
Import all of the projects into Eclipse (RCP).
